#All-The-Fishes 1: 
I tried to replicate a saltwater fish tank with fish being a clownfish, yellow tang, and angelfish. I also included coral and an anemone.

All-The-Fishes 2: I made one of the angelfish with the ability to change to a random color with the push of a button. I made another angelfish have the ability to be moved arround via the mouse. Finally I made a tang with a bar that allowed for size changing.
